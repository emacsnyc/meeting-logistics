Speakers' Guide for EmacsNYC
----------------------------

You're interested in speaking at EmacsNYC? Great! We'll just need you
to do a couple things to get ready...

### What we need

Please send `admin@emacsnyc.org` an email that includes:

- Your preferred name
- Job title and company, if applicable (only used in the video)
- Title of the talk
- Brief abstract for the talk (four or five sentences, probably)
- Link to your homepage or preferred website(s)
- A note giving us permission to record and distribute the video under
  the [CC BY-SA] license.

### Things to do before your talk

- For in-person talks, your laptop will need to support DisplayPort or
  HDMI. If it doesn't, please let us know ASAP!
- If you're on a Mac, you can record your desktop with QuickTime or
  using the capture screen functionality(⌘+5)
- If you're on Linux, please install [recordMyDesktop].
- If you're on some other Unix, please let us know and we will work to
  find a reasonable solution.
- We're not sure how to record a good screencast (with audio) on
  Windows. If you're a Windows user, please come up with a solution
  that works (and let us know what it is, for future reference)!
- If you're on a Mac and you'd like to display your keystrokes on
  screen as you type, consider installing [Keycastr]. It's
  BSD-licensed!
- Ask for Eric's phone number for emergencies if he forgets to give it
  to you =)

### Reminders for during the talk

- Don't move around *too* much. The camera's watching, so please try
  to remain in its field of view.
- If you get audience questions, please repeat them into the mic.
