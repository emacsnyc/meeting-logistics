Logistics for Organizing an EmacsNYC Meetup
-------------------------------------------

### As early as possible

- [ ] Book speaker(s)
- [ ] Direct speaker(s) to the speaker's guide.
- [ ] Announce meetup on `meetup.com`
    - Include the title and abstract for each speaker's talk, and link
      to the speaker's website (if available).
    - Include the thoughtbot location and mention that it's in a
      WeWork.
- [ ] Post on `emacsnyc.org`
    - Same content as above.
    - Adding a `scheduled:` tag with a date in the post's YAML will
      treat it as a meetup announcement in the website's header
- [ ] Reserve the appropriate room through WeWork. Ensure that folding
  chairs are available.

### The day before

- [ ] Ensure that the following equipment is available and packed:
    - [ ] Camera
    - [ ] Camera tripod
    - [ ] Audio recorder
    - [ ] Recorder tripod
    - [ ] Projector (if needed)
    - [ ] Screen (if needed)
- [ ] Ensure that someone will be available to greet people in the
  lobby and key them up the elevator.
- [ ] Ensure that a big poster is available for the front door of
  WeWork.

### The Big Day

- [ ] Use the count on meetup to estimate the number of attendants.
- [ ] Order pizza. As a guideline, 50 people eat about 12 large
  pizzas.
- [ ] Post a poster on the WeWork door.

### During the event

- [ ] Set up the camera/projector/screen/recorder
    - Definitely keep using the recorder, the production quality is
      very high.
    - Use the miniature tripod with the recorder, since it improves
      sound quality significantly.
    - Zoom in so the frame is from the speaker's arm to the edge of
      the projector screen; everything else is wasted space.
    - Try to illuminate the speaker a little to reduce the contrast
      between the speaker and the screen: cameras love light!
    - Run the screen capture software to include laptop mic audio as a
      source as well. It makes syncing easier!
    - Keep a clear line of sight between the projector and the
      speaker. Remove chairs that may sprout heads. Additionally, when
      people move the camera will attempt to autofocus on them!
- [ ] Start the event at 6:30
- [ ] Open up for announcements and lightning talks at 7:00
- [ ] Try to get the main presentation(s) rolling by 7:15
- [ ] If there are two talks, have a brief break between them
- [ ] Try to close up by 9:00

### The day after

- [ ] Conduct a brief retrospective to see what we should have done differently.
- [ ] Send the videos and audio to Thom for editing.
- [ ] Contact the speakers for links to their slides, code, and screencasts.

### The week after

- [ ] Get the videos from Thom.
- [ ] Have Harry upload the videos to S3.
- [ ] Post links to the videos and other materials on the *videos*
  page on `emacsnyc.org`.
